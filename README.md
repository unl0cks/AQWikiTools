## Overview

**AQWikiTools** is a free, open-source browser extension (Chrome & Firefox) built for [AdventureQuest Worlds](https://www.aq.com/) players who browse the [AQW Wiki](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/). It injects rich functionality directly into wiki and account pages — hover previews, merge/quest calculators, owned-item indicators, full dark mode, and a standalone Farm Tracker with thousands of items — so you never have to leave the wiki to plan your next grind.

The extension syncs your in-game inventory from [account.aq.com](https://account.aq.com) and uses it across every feature: highlighting items you own, calculating what you still need, and tracking your overall collection progress.

---

## Is It Safe?

**Yes.** AQWikiTools is 100% open source — every line of code is right here for you to inspect. Here's what you should know:

| Concern | Answer |
|---------|--------|
| **Is the code open?** | Yes. Every file is publicly available in this repository under the [MIT License](LICENSE). |
| **Does it collect my data?** | **No.** The extension does not send your data anywhere. Everything is stored locally in your browser via `chrome.storage.local`. |
| **Does it access my AQW account?** | It reads your public inventory from `account.aq.com` (a page you're already logged into). It never touches your password or login credentials. |
| **What permissions does it need?** | Only `storage` (to save settings locally) and access to `artix.com` (to check server boosts). That's it. |
| **Can I verify it myself?** | Absolutely. You can scan the ZIP on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) before extracting, read every `.js` file in this repo, or use Chrome's built-in extension audit at `chrome://extensions`. |
| **Does it run in the background?** | Only a minimal service worker that proxies fetch requests to the wiki (to bypass CORS). No background data collection, no analytics, no tracking. |

> **Tip:** If you're still unsure, download the ZIP and upload it to [VirusTotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/) — it's a free tool by Google that scans files with 70+ antivirus engines. You'll see it comes back clean.
